> If you are looking at this repo - I made it for my undergraduate thesis at UVM, *Predicting Binge Drinking With Artificial Neural Networks*, in 2014. As you can see, that was a long time ago, so this code is not representative of what I write now. Think of this repo as a historical artifact in my journey to becoming a software engineer.


ArtificialNeuralNetwork
=======================
Open Issues:  
- Extensive testing and fixing, possibly add an online training method.

Later:
- Ensure actual generalizability by testing with other arff files
